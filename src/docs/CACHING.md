# Next.js Caching Strategies

This document outlines the caching strategies implemented in our Next.js application.

## Overview

Our application uses Next.js's built-in caching mechanisms to optimize performance and reduce server load. The caching strategy is designed to balance freshness of data with performance optimization.

## Caching Mechanisms

### 1. React Server Components Cache

Server Components are cached automatically by Next.js. When a Server Component is rendered, its result is stored in the React Server Component Cache. This cache persists across requests until the application is deployed again.

**Implementation:**
- Most of our page components are implemented as Server Components
- Data fetching is performed at the server level
- Client components are used only for interactive elements

### 2. Data Cache

The Data Cache stores the results of `fetch` requests made in Server Components and Route Handlers.

**Implementation:**
- Centralized cache configuration in `src/app/caching-config.ts`
- Custom cache durations for different types of data
- Cache tags for targeted revalidation

Example:
```typescript
// Fetch with caching
const response = await fetch(url, {
  ...getCacheOptions(
    CACHE_TIMES.PRICING,
    [CACHE_TAGS.PRICING_PACKAGES]
  )
});
```

### 3. Full Route Cache

Next.js caches the rendered result of static routes at build time and dynamic routes at request time.

**Implementation:**
- Static routes: Home page, pricing packages page
- Dynamic routes with ISR: Dashboard page with revalidation time

Example:
```typescript
// Configure ISR with revalidation
export const revalidate = CACHE_TIMES.DASHBOARD;
```

### 4. Router Cache

The Router Cache stores the payload of previously visited routes on the client.

**Implementation:**
- Automatic with Next.js App Router
- Enhanced with prefetching for common navigation paths

### 5. Request Memoization

Next.js automatically deduplicates fetch requests with the same URL and options during a React render pass.

**Implementation:**
- Leveraged automatically by our fetch calls in Server Components
- Helps prevent duplicate requests during server rendering

## Cache Control Headers

We set appropriate cache control headers for API responses to enable CDN caching and browser caching.

Example:
```typescript
return NextResponse.json(data, {
  status: 200,
  headers: getCacheControlHeaders(CACHE_TIMES.PRICING)
});
```

## Revalidation Strategies

### 1. Time-based Revalidation

We use time-based revalidation for semi-static data that changes occasionally.

Example:
```typescript
// Revalidate every hour
next: {
  revalidate: CACHE_TIMES.PRICING
}
```

### 2. On-demand Revalidation

We use on-demand revalidation for data that needs to be refreshed immediately after updates.

Implementation:
- API routes for revalidation
- Server actions for revalidation
- Cache tag-based revalidation

Example:
```typescript
// Revalidate a specific tag
revalidateTag(CACHE_TAGS.PRICING_PACKAGES);
```

## Cache Management

We provide UI controls for administrators to manually revalidate cache when needed.

Implementation:
- `CacheManager` component for admin users
- Utility functions in `cacheRevalidation.ts`

## Best Practices

1. **Centralized Configuration**: All cache durations and tags are defined in `caching-config.ts`
2. **Consistent Patterns**: We use the same caching patterns across similar components
3. **Targeted Revalidation**: We use specific cache tags to revalidate only what's necessary
4. **Fallback Data**: We provide fallback data when API requests fail
5. **Error Handling**: We handle cache-related errors gracefully

## Monitoring and Debugging

- Cache hits/misses are logged in development
- Cache-related errors are captured and reported
- Cache status can be monitored in the admin dashboard
